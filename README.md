djangocms-markdown
==================

This is a plugin for django-cms that aims to replace the standard text plugin
with it's WYSIWYG editors. With cmsplugin-markdown you can write your content
in Markdown using EpicEditor (http://oscargodson.github.com/EpicEditor/)

**There are several versions of djangocms-markdown (aka cmsplugin-markdown)
floating around. I try to keep this one up-to-date and easily installable via
pip. Pull requests welcome!**
